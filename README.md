## DDash Defi Dashboard

This is the source code of the DDash Project, built during GR12 (Grants Round 12) for the [Defi Dashboard Bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/subquery/grants/2/100027176) offered by [Subquery Network](https://subquery.network/) and sponsored by [Acala](https://acala.network/)

## Overview of the App

DDash is a DeFi tool inspired by [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/), which can show an overview of your Karura account balance/any address you'd search in the **Search Bar**

### Video demo: https://youtu.be/gXzEs8141bE
### Used SubQuery project: https://explorer.subquery.network/subquery/AcalaNetwork/karura
## ⚠️ Notes

- Currently the official Karura endpoint isn't working correctly, so this project had to rely on the endpoint used by the [Karura DApp](https://apps.karura.network/) (https://api.polkawallet.io/acala-subql)
- The current Vercel deployment will fallback to a 404 in the case you're refreshing after you've searched for an address (WIP - Issue related to React Router v6)
